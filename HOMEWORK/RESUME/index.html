                <p>
                        Leila Thompson is a fourth year student, currently persuing her Bachelor's of Art in Ecosystem Science and Policy at the University of Miami.
                    </br> 
                    </br>Leila's work is a mix between classic scientific illustration and various digital mediums; She often uses her background in science to influence
                    her creative work which shows in her personal projects that she persues outside of her formal work and education.
